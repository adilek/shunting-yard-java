This implementation is not fully functional. It uses just +,-,*,/ and ^ at all. 

The codes are only for educational purposes. It needs to be optimized to be used in production. 

The purpose of writing it was to create an implementation on Scratch. It was bit harder to write in on Scratch from scratch and I wrote it on Java then translated.
